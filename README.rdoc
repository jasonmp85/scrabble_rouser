= ScrabbleRouser

ScrabbleRouser is a Ruby gem and command-line tool for generating optimal
moves in Scrabble and Scrabble-like games. It largely exists as a personal
amusement and self-improvement project: I have been coding in Ruby for a bit
over three months but haven't got a feel for setting up a project on my own.
Additionally, this gives me a chance to test out various AI strategies in
Scrabble.

I hope to eventually package {Tesseract
OCR}[http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/] as a native gem and add support
to +scrabble_rouser+, so keep an eye out for future developments in that
space.

== Basic Usage

Install the scrabble_rouser gem to get started:

 gem install scrabble_rouser

This will install the libraries and documentation for the gem as well as a
+scrabble_rouser+ binary. Until I get around to writing some examples, you're
own your own when it comes to the libraries. Use something like
YARD[http://yardoc.org/] to browse my documentation. As far as the binary
tool goes, the following command will generate optimal moves using the
specified dictionary, rack letters, and board:

 scrabble_rouser --dictionary path/to/words.txt 'RCKLTRS' path/to/board.txt

You can type +scrabble_rouser --help+ for additional details.

== Configuration

Everything is configured via command-line flags. Caching and configuration
files are planned for a future release.
