    # This class implements <em>The World's Fastest Scrabble
    # Program</em> (well, as of 1988 anyways), from the
    # paper bearing the same name by Andrew W. Appel and
    # Guy J. Jacobson.
    #
    # The algorithm has some places where statefulness can
    # allow optimizations; instances of this class
    # encapsulate that state.
